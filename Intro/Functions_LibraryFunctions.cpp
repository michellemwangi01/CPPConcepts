//C++ LIBRARY FUNCTIONS
//Built-in functions in c++ programming e.g sqrt(), abs(), main()
//In order to use these library functions, we need to include the header file in which those library functions are defined 
//example: to use math functions mentioned above, we need to include <cmath> header file at the beginning of our code

int main(){

//program to find square root of a number.
double num, numroot;
cout<<"Enter a number to find it's Squareroot:"<<endl;
cin>>num;
numroot = sqrt(num);
cout<<"The root of the number is: "<<numroot<<endl;
